== Curent milestone: 0.1

* Clear all TODOs/FIXMEs in code
* RunnerSessionData::busy/setBusy
    * make visible in the model
* RunnerSessionData::updateMatches
* Replacement for Plasma::QuerySyntax that is actually useful for:
    * run time help / hints for the user
    * automatic query construction
    * pre-threading query filtering (e.g. in RunnerSessionData::shouldStartMatching)
* QueryMatch execution
    * Pass into an AbstractRunner::exec type method
    * Learning: record chosen QueryMatches, weight future matches with this information
    * QueryMatch::isSearchTerm() for re-searchables
* Query pre-processing (similar to Plasma::RunnerContext)
* move from QThreadPool::global to a private threadpool (so as not to interfere with host application usage of same)
* Improved "single runner" mode
* Runners advertise what kind of matches they return (source, type, ..?)
