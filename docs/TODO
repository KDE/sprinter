= Curent milestone: 0.1

== Features
* add paging support to setMatches / updateMatches

== Improvements
* Clear TODOs/FIXMEs in code

== Bugfixes
* Ensure all threads cleaned up before exit

= Next milestone: 0.2

== Features
* Learning: record chosen QueryMatches, weight future matches with this information
* Expand RunnerSessionData::shouldStartMatch with more powerful filtering
    * A MatchType filter (from user, or UI component)
    * Query term pre-processing?

== Improvements
* Improve RunnerSessionData::updateMatches
* Implement merging in setMatches

= Unscheduled
* Provide per-plugin help in the json file, exported to the RunnerModel
* Add application affiliation to the json & export to RunnerModel
    * With model filtering, it becomes easy to get plugins relevant to a specific application
* Tiered match run priorities on runners set by the user
    * 0 - in worker thread; 1 launched first in threadpool; 2 launch last in threadpool
    * a launcher might request app launchers in tier 0, e.g.
* Query pre-processing (similar to Plasma::RunnerContext::Private::determineType)
    * this may actually be unecessary, or at least not as useful as was expected when krunner was in devel?
* Actions on matches
    * Could be done using QueryMatch::isSearchTerm to refine search?
* MatchType specializations
    * Allow QueryMatch to have a "free-form" QString that would represent an optional specialation to MatchType? (Only makes sense if this is a common requirement, as it incurs more overhead for all matches)
* Runner plugin test harness that "tortures" runners to see how they perform
    * Correctness of results
    * Threading safety
    * Speed
* Allow unloading of runners in RunnerModel
    * currently Runner plugins hang out in memory once access the first time
    * ref counted and delete when no longer used
* QueryMatch::isSearchTerm should allow setting whether to only run against the same runner that generated it (relies on a single-runner mode)
* Runner plugin configuration
