= Curent milestone: 0.1

== Features
* QAbstractItemModel *RunnerManager::runnersModel(), with following info per runner (row):
    * QString plugin ID/name
    * QString user visible name
    * bool loaded
    * bool busy (this comes from the session data in the RunnerManagerThread)
* Design and imlement an improved Plasma::QuerySyntax that is useful for:
    * run time help / hints for the user
    * automatic query construction
    * pre-threading query filtering (e.g. in RunnerSessionData::shouldStartMatching)
* QueryMatch execution
    * QueryMatch::isSearchTerm() for re-searchables
    * Learning: record chosen QueryMatches, weight future matches with this information
* Query pre-processing (similar to Plasma::RunnerContext)
* Design and implement an improved (relative to krunner) "single runner" mode
* Runners advertise what kind of matches they return (source, type, ..?)

== Improvements
* Clear all TODOs/FIXMEs in code
* Improve RunnerSessionData::updateMatches
* Implement proper merging in setMatches
* Move private methods in RunnerManager into Private class

== Bugfixes
* Ensure all threads cleaned up before exit
